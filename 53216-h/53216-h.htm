<p>SIR,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR extensive knowlege in
every branch of useful and polite
literature will sufficiently justify the
propriety of this address, though it offers
to your acceptance and protection
an Essay merely medical. Besides, the
subject I have chosen is in a great measure
new, and must, I think, if successfully
treated, prove highly useful.
It seems therefore peculiarly intitled to
your patronage, who are so judicious,
so generous, and so zealous a promoter
of every discovery which may tend to
the public good. I shall not trespass
farther on your patience, with the usual
apologies of young Authors; nor on
your modesty, with the trite panegyrics
of Dedicators: the whole tenour
of your life has render’d such encomiums
superfluous; for you have always
pursued the shortest and the surest
road to fame, the real <i>esse quod videri
velis</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">Though by this Essay I should acquire
no honour from the judicious
Sons of Æsculapius; this one however
I am sure of, the subscribing myself</p>

<p class="right padr3">Your most obliged,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>Eing much afflicted with the Night-mare,
self-preservation made me particularly inquisitive
about it. In consulting the ancient
Physicians, I found little information concerning
it, except dreadful prognostics; nor could
a rational account of it be expected from them,
as they were unacquainted with the circulation
of the Blood.</p>

<p>The few Authors who have mention’d it
since that glorious discovery, have also given
imperfect accounts of it; which are probably
owing to their not having felt it themselves:
for, as it only seizes People in sleep, continues
but a short time, and vanishes as soon as they
awake, the Physician has not an opportunity
of making observations of his own, but must
take all from the description of others, who
have labour’d under it. These, I believe, are
the reasons that the principal Writers in Physic
have taken so little notice of it. These omissions
however render an enquiry into the nature
of this Disease the more interesting and
necessary, and, at the same time, the more difficult.</p>

<p class="tb">Under these disadvantages I have ventur’d to
communicate the result of my own observations
and reflexions on it; hoping, that a greater
allowance will be made for the errors in this
Essay, as it is perhaps the first that ever appear’d
expressly on this subject.</p>

<p>The Night-mare is commonly, and, I believe,
justly, attributed to a stagnation of the
Blood; but how this stagnation is produc’d,
has not been explain’d, so far as I know, in
a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>I have carefully collected the observations of
the ancient Physicians concerning the prognostics
of this Disorder; not for ostentation, but
to shew at the same time the dangerous consequences
and antiquity of it, in order to make
those afflicted with it the more solicitous to remove
its cause in the beginning; for it may be
said of the Night-mare, as of many other Disorders,
<i>Vires acquirit eundo</i>.</p>

<p>Though the most temperate are sometimes
afflicted with this Disease, yet experience shews
that it is generally the offspring of excess:
hence it must have been nearly <i>coeval</i> with Bacchus
(though it be omitted by the <i>Coan Oracle</i>;)
and Homer probably alludes to its symptoms in
the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Ως δ’ εν ὀνείρω ὀυ δύναται Φευγοντα διωκειν</div>
<div class="line">Οὔτ’ αρ ὁ δύναται ὑποfευγειν, ὄυθ’ ὁ διωκειν.</div>
<div class="line i15">Iliad xxii.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have not introduc’d any thing in this
Essay that did not appear serious or probable.
I have therefore omitted an inquiry into the
origin of many odd epithets and quaint names
commonly given to this Disorder; such as <i>Hag-riding</i>,
<i>Wizard-pressing</i>, <i>Mare-riding</i>, <i>Witch-dancing</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, nor did I think it requisite to
mention particularly the <i>curious Charms</i> adapted
to each superstitious name.</p>

<p>My aim has been to convey my sentiments
with as much brevity and perspicuity as possible.
If I have transgress’d this rule, in occasionally
introducing some things known, in order to explain
others, it was to be the more intelligible;
I therefore hope, the more learned will excuse
me.</p>

<p>With pleasure I take this opportunity of acknowledging
how much the hints I receiv’d
from the instructive lectures of my ingenious
Preceptor Mr. Monro, contributed to this undertaking.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt2">CHAP. I.</span><br /><br />

<small><i>Of the history and the various opinions
concerning the cause of this Disorder.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N order to convey a distinct idea
of the subject of the following
pages, I shall, according to the
old custom of medical authors, begin
with the etymology of it.</p>

<p>Altho’ we have reason to believe,
as will afterwards appear, that this
Disease was known long before the
Greek language, yet, the earliest account
we have of it, is from the Greek
authors, who call’d it Εφιαλτης, and the
Romans nam’d it Incubus, both which
words partly express its effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In our language it is generally known
by the name of the <span class="smcap">Night-mare</span>;
which strange term probably arose from
superstitious notions which the British
had, and perhaps still have, of it.
How it first obtain’d this odd appellation,
I never could learn, nor is it
material to know, since that name is
sufficient to distinguish it from every
other Disease.</p>

<p>The Night-mare generally seizes
people sleeping on their backs, and often
begins with frightful dreams, which
are soon succeeded by a difficult respiration,
a violent oppression on the
breast, and a total privation of voluntary
motion. In this agony they sigh,
groan, utter indistinct sounds, and remain
in the jaws of death, till, by
the utmost efforts of nature, or some
external assistance, they escape out of
that dreadful torpid state.</p>

<p>As soon as they shake off that vast
oppression, and are able to move the
body, they are affected with a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Palpitation, great Anxiety, Languor,
and Uneasiness; which symptoms gradually
abate, and are succeeded by the
pleasing reflection of having escap’d
such imminent danger. All these symptoms
I have often felt, and hope, that
whoever has had, or may have, this
Disease, will readily know it by this
description, which I have not only taken
from my own feelings, but from
the observations of many of my acquaintances,
who were also afflicted
with it, and from the records of the
antient observators.</p>

<p>Before I enter into an enquiry concerning
the cause of this Disorder, or
attempt to assign any one for it myself,
I shall first take notice of the principal
opinions that have been advanc’d
to account for it, and examine how
far they are confident with the laws
of the animal œconomy; that the judicious
reader may see how necessary
further enquiries into the nature of this
Disorder may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Willis says, That the Night-mare
is owing to some incongruous
matter which is mix’d with the Nervous
Fluid in the Cerebellum<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>. But,
as he has not told us what this matter
is, or how it is produced, we can afford
it little credit in this enquiry; because
plethoric persons, who abound
with the purest and richest Blood, in
whom such incongruous matter is suppos’d
least to prevail, are most subject
to this Disorder<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.</p>

<p>Bellini, who, in many other cases,
is allow’d to be a pretty accurate theorist,
was strangely mistaken in this,
when he said, That the Night-mare
is an imaginary Disease, and proceeds
from the idea of some demon, which
existed in the mind the day before<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.</p>

<p>This account is very unworthy a
physician, and is a strong evidence that
he never felt the heavy effects of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Disorder; otherwise he would have
allow’d it to be a real Disease of the
Body.</p>

<p>A metaphysician has laid great stress
on this Disease, as an argument in
defence of some of his wild opinions.
He asserts, That it is owing to the operation
of certains demons, which impose
on, and torment, the mind in
sleep<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.</p>

<p>This ingenious hint he took from
Bellini, who probably stole it from
Paracelsus’s doctrine of Archeus faber<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.</p>

<p>The ingenious Doctor Lower is the
first author I met with, who observ’d
the horizontal position of the Body,
and assign’d it as a remote cause of
this Disorder, but seems to attribute it
immediately to a collection of Lymph
in the fourth Ventricle of the Brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>He says, “Si supine dormiant, Ventriculus
ille quartus, Lympha nimium
distensus, Medullam Oblongatam
sua gravitate premit, ideoque
fluxum liquidi Nervosi in Nervis
cordi &amp; respirationi inservientibus
impedit<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not apply his first
observation so well as might be expected
from one of his abilities; for it seems
needless to wait for a slow secretion of
Lymph to produce this Disease, since,
according to his own account, the return
of the Blood from the Head, by
the Jugular Veins, is in some measure
prevented, and by that means a greater
quantity of Blood than usual will be
collected in all the vessels of the Brain;
which might better answer his purpose,
and more effectually obstruct the nervous
influence. But before either of
these causes could be removed by common
methods, life would be at an end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>and every fit of the Night-mare would
be mortal; but that it often happens
otherwise, many can testify. Doctor
Lower seems to have founded this theory
on the dissection of a Man who
died of a Hydrocephalus, and not immediately
of the Night-mare: hence
that case is ill applied by Bonetus<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt2">CHAP. I</span>I.<br /><br />

<small><i>An enquiry concerning the real cause
of the Night-mare.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>Aving mentioned the most remarkable
opinions, that have occurr’d
to me concerning the cause of
this Disease, and shewn them all defective,
I shall next consider several
circumstances attending an horizontal
position of the Body in sleep, in which
alone this disease is felt; and endeavour
from thence to investigate the real
cause of it.</p>

<p>Sleep is the balmy anodyne of nature;
and was intended, by the all-wise
Author of our being, to ease the
toils of the body, dispel the cares of
the mind, and to repair the losses sustain’d
by the fatigue of the day. In
it we see every external stimulus remov’d,
the Senses lock’d up, and every
Muscle relax’d, except the Heart, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Sphincters, and those concern’d in respiration.
Nutrition is then principally
perform’d, and then only the Fluids
glide equably through the Vessels.</p>

<p>As many of the voluntary Muscles
are imployed in keeping the Body
erect, ’tis necessary that the Body should
be in an inclin’d or horizontal position,
in order to relax them, and promote
the salutary end of sleep. Accordingly
we find, that most of the
brute, as well as the human Species,
chuse some easy posture of this kind
to sleep in.</p>

<p>When the human Body lies horizontally,
the Blood must flow in greater
abundance to the Head; and with a
greater momentum, cæteris paribus,
through the Carotid and Vertebral Arteries,
than when the Body stands erect;
because the Blood, moving through
these tubes in an horizontal direction,
will not so much resist the force of the
Heart, as when it ascends perpendicularly
contrary to its own gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>No one, I presume, will doubt the
truth of this proposition, who reflects,
that it is much easier to move any
spherical body on an horizontal plane,
than to raise the same body up against
a perpendicular wall.</p>

<p>Neither will it be denied, that the
quantity as well as the velocity of
Blood, flowing into the Carotid and
Vertebral Arteries, is increas’d by the
horizontal position of the Body, if it
be consider’d, that these tubes (particularly
the left Carotid) arise from, and
proceed almost parallel with the axis
of the Aorta, where the velocity of
the Blood rushing out of the Heart is
greatest. Whence it follows, from Sir
Isaac Newton’s second general law of
motion, and from a well known axiom
in hydraulics, that these Arteries must
receive more Blood in the same time,
than any other branches of the Aorta
of the same diameter.</p>

<p>As the Blood must lose most of the
motion which it receives from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Heart, in passing through the infinite
vascular ramifications, and fine filtres
of the Brain, there scarce appears, even
in an erect position of the Body, any
propelling power to push it back again
to the Heart, except we admit the pulsation
of the small Arteries belonging
to the coats of the Sinuses, and its own
gravity. But in an horizontal position,
the Blood has not the advantage of its
gravity to accelerate its motion through
the Jugular Veins; therefore it must
move slower, and must be more subject
to obstruction in the vessels of the
Brain. Hence we see the use of pillows
is to promote and facilitate the
return of the Blood through the Jugular
Veins: hence we may also observe,
the uneasiness and danger attending
the too common method of making
the feet of beds higher than the
heads, since a stoppage of the Blood
is always productive of dangerous consequences;
of which any one may be
soon convinc’d by stooping the Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
for a short time; and it will appear,
that the Blood is by this means collected
in the Veins of the Face, which
will produce a Vertigo, and, if long
continued, may bring on an Apoplexy.
Hence we sometimes hear of people
dropping down dead, upon stooping
to buckle their shoes. These instances
should deter some from putting their
pillows under their feet, in order to
make the Blood settle in their faces,
and to decorate the external part of
their Heads at the expence of the internal.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the inconveniences
and bad effects which may arise from
the Blood’s delay in the Brain, yet, its
being sent to the Head in sleep in a
greater quantity, may serve many necessary
purposes, and render sleep more
beneficial and refreshing to animals.
First, by distending the Blood-vessels
of the Cerebrum, increasing the pressure
on that part, and by that means
producing sleep. Secondly, by pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>moting
the secretion, and preparing a
store of animal spirits to supply the
expence of the ensuing day. Thirdly,
by gently encreasing the pressure of the
Blood-vessels on the Cerebellum, and
perhaps determining a greater quantity
of the nervous influence to the Heart,
respiratory Muscles, and other parts,
whose Nerves spring from that fountain
of life. This pressure on the Cerebellum
may concur with the rarefaction
of the fluids, to render the motions
of these organs more regular and
vigorous in sleep.</p>

<p>To this mechanical pressure on the
Cerebellum, the illustrious Van Sweiten
seems to attribute the motion of the
Heart: “Cerebelli enim actio in Cor
per Nervos, pendet ab ipsa actione
Cordis per Arterias<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>.”</p>

<p>Tho’ the contraction of the Heart
is evidently the efficient cause of the
Blood’s motion, and consequently of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>the secretion of these spirits in the Cerebellum,
yet, without these spirits, the
action of the Heart could not be performed.
These two causes appear to
act in a circle, and mutually depend
on each other. Hence Hippocrates divin’d,
ὁλον το ζωμα κυκλος εστι. These also
convey the idea of a perpetuum mobile;
since, as long as life lasts, an animal is
really such, and far excels any machine
that human art has been yet able to
make, or (in the opinion of many philosophers)
will ever invent.</p>

<p>The laborious Hoffman ascribes a great
deal to this pressure on the Brain, where
he says, “<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>Declivior cubitus sanguinis
regressum quodammodo impedit, quia
per venas jugulares descendere debet,
quod elatiori capite commodius peragitur.
Hinc, capite nimis demisso
ac depresso, profundiores somnii cum
insomniis, fiunt, universo corpore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>torpor inducitur. Eadem ratione,
si quis facie prona velut in mensa,
in somnum delabitur. Ob difficiliorem

accersit.”</p>

<p>“<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>Sed etiam mechanicæ causæ somnum
producunt, compressio nempe

Osse, aquæ in Ventriculis copia.”</p>

<p>These, I hope, are sufficient to shew
how far the motion of the fluids may
be affected by the horizontal position
of the Body; which, if duly consider’d,
might be of great service in the practice
of Physic; and perhaps many effectual
derivations might be made, without
drawing a drop of Blood. I saw
a remarkable instance of this kind in
a gentleman of a full habit, who, being
ill of a Fever, talk’d rationally and
rav’d alternately, as his head was ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>vated
or depress’d. In acute Diseases,
when the motion of the Blood is very
rapid through the whole Body, the
Brain must suffer greatly, on account
of the horizontal position, to which
people in such cases are confin’d; because,
the Blood rushing violently into
the Arteries of the Brain, and its return
being retarded by the Jugular Veins,
will remarkably contribute to produce
delirious symptoms, so frequent in acute
Disorders, which might be in some
measure prevented, by raising the Head;
for, by that means, the motion of the
Blood through the Jugular Veins will
be increas’d, the pressure on the Brain
will be eas’d, and a safe and sudden
derivation from the Head may be made,
which may produce very happy effects,
where no evacuation could be safely
attempted.</p>

<p>Let us next take a view of the Heart,
and consider how it may be affected
by the various positions of the Body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
particularly the supine one, in which
the Night-mare generally invades.</p>

<p>The Heart is placed above the Diaphragm:
the greater part of it lies in
the left cavity of the Breast: its apex
or point is turn’d towards the extremity
of the sixth true Rib, where its pulsations
are commonly felt: it adheres
to the Lungs by its large vessels, and
is connected to the Diaphragm by the
Pericardium<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the Heart is suspended in the
Breast; and therefore must be subject to
the laws of pendulous bodies, which
alter their situation according to the
different directions of their centers of
gravity.</p>

<p>From the above just description of
the human Heart, ’tis evident, that
when the Body is erect, the parts of
the Heart which are commonly called
the right and left, ought to be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>properly call’d the anterior and posterior.</p>

<p>Hence, when the Body is plac’d on
the Back, these become the superior
and inferior parts of the Heart.</p>

<p>That the Heart alters its situation
in the Breast according to the different
positions of the Body, and the different
directions of its center of gravity,
may be prov’d by the following easy
experiments.</p>

<p>If the Finger be applied to that part
of the Ribs where the pulsation is felt
in an erect position; and if, at the
same time, the Diaphragm be contracted
strongly, the beatings become immediately
weaker, because the Heart is pulled
downwards by the Diaphragm.</p>

<p>If one lies on the left side, the point
of the Heart is felt beating nearer the
Spine of the Back; if we turn on our
Backs, it is scarce perceptible; and if
we lie on the right side, it intirely vanishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>These alterations of the Heart’s situation
in the Breast, are more remarkable
in some persons than in others;
and in general I have found, by repeated
tryals, that they were most considerable
in those who were most subject
to the Night-mare.</p>

<p>When the Body lies supine, the
Heart necessarily falls on the Vertebræ
of the Spine; and therefore, by its
own gravity, must compress the left
Auricle and Pulmonary Veins, which,
at that time, lie directly under its basis;
and, by that means, the course of
the Blood through the Lungs will be
stop’d. Thus the Blood will be collected
in the Pulmonary Vessels, and
the right, or rather superior Ventricle,
not being able to discharge itself into
the Pulmonary Artery, will be oppressed
by the Blood returning from the
Extremities; which, being gather’d in
the vessels about the superior part of
the Heart, will increase its gravity, and
consequently augment the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
obstruction. In this manner the return
of the Blood from the Head will be
prevented, the tender dilatable vessels
of the Brain will be over-distended,
the nervous influence obstructed, and
the vital motions, in a great measure,
if not altogether, stopt. This I take
to be a real fit of the Night-mare, and
in this manner it appears to be produc’d.</p>

<small><i>An account of the Symptoms.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>Aving now discover’d what appears,
to me, to be the immediate
cause of the Night-mare, viz. the
pressure of the Heart on the left or inferior
Auricle and Pulmonary Veins,
which stops the motion of the Blood
through the Lungs, and occasions a
general stagnation; let us examine how
that hypothesis will account for the several
Phænomena or Symptoms, mention’d
formerly in the description of
this Disease.</p>

<p>The first Symptoms that occur in that
catalogue, are frightful Dreams, which
generally are the forerunners of this
Disorder. “In hoc genere (Somniorum)
est Εφιαλτης quem publica persuasio
quiescentes opinatur invadere,
ac sentientes pondere suo gravare<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall not here undertake to solve
that Phænomenon, which has so long
puzzled the Metaphysicians, nor pretend
to account for all kinds of dreams
in a mechanical manner.</p>

<p>However, every one knows that the
harmony and connection between the
Body and the Mind are so establish’d
and constituted, while they are united,
that the Diseases of the one always
affect the other in a very sensible manner;
and experience daily demonstrates,
that violent passions of the mind produce
Fevers, Fainting Fits, and other
severe effects on the Body; e. contra,
violent shocks of the Body, acute Diseases,
&amp;c. frequently disturb, and raise
strange commotions in the Mind, or
at least excite extravagant, wild ideas
in it. Accordingly we find, that the
most eminent Physicians have not
scrupl’d to assert, that these effects are
often owing to Obstructions and Inflammations
of the Membranes of the
Brain. If so, may not the violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
distentions of the Vessels of the Brain
(which always precedes and attends a
fit of the Night-mare) make such strong
impressions on the origin of the Nerves,
or Sensorium Commune, as to occasion
hideous associations of ideas, and form
frightful spectres in the imagination?
Are not these monstrous dreams intended
as a stimulus to rouse the sentient
principle in us, that we might alter the
position of the Body, and by that
means avoid the approaching danger?
Is not the horizontal posture of the
Body, which produces a Plethora in
the Vessels of the Brain, and many odd
sensations, the most general cause of
dreams? Do they ever dream, who
sleep in an erect position? Are not
the luxurious and the plethoric most
subject to disagreeable dreams? Is not
the motion and titillation of the Animalculæ
in Semine Masculino, the cause
of the agreeable dreams which attend
nocturnal emissions? Have females such
emissions in sleep? Does not perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sleep consist in a total suspension of
the operations of the Mind? May not
dreaming, in general, be consider’d as
a Disorder of the Body, and justly attributed
to some cause, which stimulates
the Sensorium Commune, and
prevents perfect rest? Do people that
sleep after much fatigue, ever dream?</p>

<p>The vast oppression on the Breast,
and immobility of the Body, which
are always felt in this Disorder, probably
arise from the quantity of Blood
collected in the Lungs, Vena Cava,
right Ventricle, and Auricle of the
Heart; nor does the Mind appear to
be mistaken in this case, as some have
imagined; for it seems the same with
regard to the Mind, whether the real
action of the Muscles be constrain’d by
a superior external force, or the influence
of it over these Muscles be hinder’d
by an internal cause. In a fit
of the Night-mare, the Mind, conscious
of the dangerous situation of the
Body, in vain endeavours to alter it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
because its power over the Voluntary
Muscles is some way suspended, by the
obstruction of the Blood; yet the Mind
may exert itself as much as if it strove
to remove the greatest obstacle. In
this case the Mind generally ascribes
the immobility of the Body to some
great weight laid on the Breast; whereas
the cause is really internal: and people
judge of the greatness of the oppression,
according to the efforts nature makes
to overcome the obstruction of the
Blood in the Lungs.</p>

<p>Besides, in heavy or profound sleep,
the voluntary motions are generally
stop’d. Hence, when people awake
suddenly, they are for some time Paralytic,
before the Animal Spirits obey
the commands of the Mind, and actuate
the Muscles in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The indistinct Voice is probably owing
to the same cause; for the Muscles
of the Tongue and Larynx, which
form distinct sounds, are of the vo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>luntary
class, which, as was said before,
are generally suspended in sleep.</p>

<p>The collapsing of the Lungs, which
are, at this time, overloaded with Blood,
will exclude the air, that necessary
medium of sounds, and sole vehicle of
voice.</p>

<p>Heavy sighs and groans are the emphatic
expressions of nature in distress,
and generally arise from some obstruction
in the Lungs; but in a fit of the
Night-mare there appears a great accumulation
of Blood in the vessels of
that part, whence these Symptoms are
easily accounted for. It may be observ’d
of sighing in general, that when
the attention of the Mind is deeply
engag’d to any particular object or
sensation, and either neglects or is restrain’d
from exerting its influence over
the organs of respiration, the Blood is
stop’d in the Lungs, so that it becomes
necessary to draw in a large Chestful
of air, in order to give the Blood a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
passage from the right Ventricle of the
Heart to the left. Hence Melancholy
persons, profound Mathematicians, and
fond pining Lovers, are most subject
to that affection. Such people are also
very liable to many Hypochondriac and
Chronic Diseases; which often proceed
from a defective respiration, or a too
slow motion of the Blood through those
parts which are agitated by the alternate
dilatation and contraction of the
Thorax. Hence the Liver and Spleen
and the Lungs themselves must suffer
most when the attention of the Mind
is engag’d by some Disease of its own,
and it becomes less sensible of the Disorders
of the Body. Hence people in
Grief, &amp;c. labour under a double Disease,
which, on account of the anxiety,
weight, and oppression that is felt from
the Blood stagnating about the Heart,
is commonly termed Heart-breaking.</p>

<p>An Uneasiness or Anxiety, and Palpitation
of the Heart, are the last Symptoms
that are commonly felt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Night-mare, which proceed from the
cause lately mention’d; as ’tis then necessary
that the Heart should contract
itself more frequently, in order to discharge
the Blood collected in the Vena
Cava, the right Sinus Venosus, and
Auricle, during the fit.</p>

<p>Having done what I propos’d in this
Chapter, and given the best account
that I know of the Symptoms, I should
now proceed to the Prognostics and
method of Cure; but, as I have shewn
how the vital motions are stop’d, and
a general stagnation of the Blood is
produc’d, it is also incumbent on me
to explain how the motion of that vital
stream is renew’d by the efforts of nature
alone; otherwise it might be objected,
that, according to my theory,
unless where art interpos’d, every fit
of the Night-mare would be mortal.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt2">CHAP. I</span>V.<br /><br />

<small><i>Of the Natural Cure.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N order to shew how persons recover
out of a fit of this Disease, by
the mere efforts of nature, I shall beg
leave to premise a few of the most
probable opinions, and best establish’d
propositions, concerning Animal Motion,
which I shall here take for granted,
and refer the reader, for a physical
demonstration of them, to the ingenious
Essays of Doctors Porterfield,
Whytt, Simson, and Haller.</p>

<p>Animal and Muscular Motion is said
to be of two kinds, viz. Voluntary, and
Involuntary or Habitual.</p>

<p>By Voluntary Motion is meant the
action of any Muscle or Muscles produc’d
by an immediate or conscious
determination of the Mind; of this
kind are the several occasional motions
of the Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Involuntary or Habitual Motions are
such as proceed originally from the
Mind also, but are so establish’d, by
long custom, that the Mind is not
immediately conscious of them, nor
can stop them at pleasure<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>. To this
class, the Motion of the Heart, the
peristaltic Motion of the Stomach and
Guts, Respiration, and several Motions
of the Eyes belong.</p>

<p>The vital Motions are suppos’d to
be continued by a stimulus constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
applied to the Fibres of the Muscles
which perform them.</p>

<p>Hence the Ventricles of the Heart
are constantly irritated and stretch’d by
the Venous Blood, which brings them
into contraction, to propel the Blood
through the Body.</p>

<p>Thus the Alimentary Tube is mov’d
by the irritation of the food, rarefied
air, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And in like manner respiration is
carried on, by the uneasiness that is
felt in the Lungs at the end of every
dilatation and contraction of the Thorax,
which is owing to the resistance
that the Blood meets with, both from
the collapsing of the Lungs, and from
the pressure of the rarefied air on the
small Pulmonary Vessels, during their
expansion: to which may be added,
the elasticity of the Cartilages.</p>

<p>These several stimuli can only be
perceiv’d by a sentient principle, which,
in the human species, is call’d the Soul.</p>

<p>When the Soul is first united with
the Body, and receives command over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the organs of Motion, it seems to have
been laid under a kind of necessity,
by which it is compell’d to exert these
organs in avoiding whatever is hurtful,
and in chusing whatever is apparently
beneficial, to the Body.</p>

<p>’Tis evident, from the laws of the
Circulation, that when the Motion of
the Blood through the Lungs is stop’d,
for a short time, the right Ventricle of
the Heart must be violently distended,
and consequently severely stimulated.
This strong irritation may bring the
Ventricle into a vigorous contraction,
which is all that is wanted to put the
admirable machine again in motion;
for, as soon as the right Ventricle discharges
itself into the Pulmonary Artery,
’tis plain, from the laws of hydraulics,
that the Blood must move in
the Pulmonary Veins; and therefore
the pressure on these vessels must be
overcome. Thus the circulation of the
Blood will be renew’d, and the vast
distention of the vessels about the Heart,
will rouse the attention of the Mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to change the uneasy position of the
Body as soon as possible; which will
alter the direction of the Heart’s center
of gravity, and therefore take the pressure
off the Pulmonary Veins and inferior
Auricle, and by that means afford
a free passage to the Blood through
the Lungs. In this manner people
may recover, without any external assistance.</p>

<p>’Tis highly probable that the Motion of
the Blood is renew’d before any of the
Voluntary Motions are recovered; for
we never find that any of the Voluntary
Motions remain after the Motion of the
Heart ceases; and the surprising process
of generation shews, that the first
Motion observable in animal Bodies, is
that of the Heart<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>. We have many
instances, in Brutes, of the Heart’s
Motion continuing long after the action
of the Voluntary Muscles is quite de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>stroy’d<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.
It is not improbable, that the
human Heart would contract itself after
Death, if the same experiments
could, with any degree of humanity,
be tried on it, that are made on the
Hearts of Brutes: and the great Lord
Bacon gives an instance of a criminal’s
Heart, which he saw, after torn from
the Body, leap up and down for several
minutes<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>.</p>

<p>In a severe fit of the Night-mare,
when the Motion of the Blood, and
consequently the Motion of the Heart,
is stop’d, the Mind, must be in a terrible
agony; and the only chance it
has for further communication with
the Body, depends upon the vigour
and sensibility of the right or superior
Ventricle of the Heart; for, if it be
not able to push the Blood through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Lungs, and overcome its own weight
at the same rime, de Vita Actum est.</p>

<p>From what has been said it appears,
that lying on the Back is a dangerous,
uneasy position, and should be carefully
avoided, even when we are awake.
I believe few can lie long on the Back
without feeling an uneasiness in the
Breast, which is soon remov’d by turning
on either Side: but when People
are buried in sleep, and are incapable
of that action, the consequence is dreadful,
for the reason often mention’d.
We may be convinc’d, that, if lying
on the Back would not impede the
Vital Motions, nature would have directed
us to chuse that position in sleep,
because it requires scarcely any muscular
action. But, on the contrary, we find
that most of the human species prefer
lying on either Side.</p>

<p>As colonel Townshend’s case is a
remarkable instance of the dangerous
effects which may proceed from lying
on the Back, and as it may serve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
illustrate my theory of this Disorder,
I shall here quote it at full length, that
the reader may the more readily observe
the analogy between his mechanical
suppression of the Vital Motions, and
a fit of the Night-mare, It is thus related
by Doctor Cheyne, in his English
Malady<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.</p>

<p class="center">The CASE of the honourable
Colonel <span class="smcap">Townshend</span>.</p>

<p>“Colonel Townshend, a gentleman
of excellent natural parts, and
of great honour and integrity, had
for many years been afflicted with
a nephritic complaint, attended with
constant vomitings, which had made
his life painful and miserable. During
the whole time of his illness, he
had observ’d the strictest regimen,
living on the softest vegetables and
lightest animal foods, drinking asses
milk daily, even in the camp: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>for common drink Bristol-water,
which, the summer before his death,
he drank on the spot. But his illness
increasing, and his strength decaying,
he came from Bristol to Bath
in a litter, in autumn, and lay at
the Bell-Inn. Doctor Baynard (who
is since dead) and I were called to
him, and attended him twice a day
for the space of a week; but his
vomitings continuing still incessant,
and obstinate against all remedies,
we despair’d of his recovery. While
he was in this condition, he sent
for us early one morning: we waited
on him, with Mr. Skrine his Apothecary
(since dead also;) we found
his senses clear, and his Mind calm,
his Nurse and several Servants were
about him.</p>

<p>“He had made his will and settled
his affairs. He told us he had sent
for us to give him some account of
an odd sensation, he had for some
time observ’d and felt in himself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which was, that composing himself
he could die or expire when he pleased,
and yet, by an effort or somehow,
he could come to life again;
which it seems he had tried before
he had sent for us. We hear’d this
with surprize; but as it was not to
be accounted for from any common
principles, we could hardly believe
the fact as he related it, much less
give any account of it; unless he
would please to make the experiment
before us, which we were unwilling
he should do, lest, in his
weak condition, he might carry it
too far. He continued to talk very
distinctly and sensibly above a quarter
of an hour about this (to him)
surprising sensation, and insisted so
much on our seeing the tryal made,
that we were at last forced to comply.
We all three felt his Pulse first:
it was distinct, though small and
thready; and his Heart had its usual
beating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“He composed himself on his Back,
and lay in a still posture for some
time; while I held his Right-hand,
Doctor Baynard laid his Hand on
his Heart, and Mr. Skrine held a
clean looking-glass to his Mouth.
I found his Pulse sink gradually,
’till at last I could not feel any, by
the most exact and nice touch. Doctor
Baynard could not feel the least
motion of his Heart, nor Mr. Skrine
the least soil of breath on the bright
mirror he held to his Mouth; then
each of us by turns examin’d his
Arm, Heart, and Breath, but could
not, by the nicest scrutiny, discover
the least symptom of life in him.</p>

<p>“We reasoned a long time about
this odd appearance as well as we
could, and all of us judging it inexplicable
and unaccountable, and
finding he still continued in that
condition, we began to conclude
that he had indeed carried the experiment
too far, and at last were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
satisfied he was actually dead, and
were just ready to leave him.</p>

<p>“This continued about half an hour,
by nine o’clock in the morning in
autumn. As we were going away,
we observed some motion about the
Body, and upon examination found
his Pulse and the motion of his Heart
gradually returning: he began to
breathe gently and speak softly; we
were all astonished to the last degree
at this unexpected change, and after
some further conversation with him,
and among ourselves, went away
fully satisfied as to all the particulars
of this fact, but confounded and
puzzled, and not able to form any
rational scheme that might account
for it. He afterwards called for his
attorney, added a codicil to his will,
settled legacies on his servants, received
the sacrament, and calmly
and composedly expired about five
or six o’clock that evening. Next
day he was opened (as he had or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>dered)
his Body was the soundest and
best made I had ever seen; his Lungs
were fair, large, and sound; his
Heart big and strong, and his Intestines
sweet and clean; his Stomach
was of a due proportion, the Coats
sound and thick, and the villous
Membrane quite entire. But when
we came to examine the Kidneys,
though the left was perfectly sound,
and of a just size, the right was
about four times as big, distended
like a blown Bladder, and yielding,
as if full of pap; he having often
passed a wheyish liquor after his
urine, during his illness.</p>

<p>“Upon opening this Kidney, we
found it quite full of a white chalky
matter, like plaister of Paris, and all
the fleshy substance dissolved and
worn away, by what I called a Nephritic
Cancer. This had been the
source of all his misery; and the
symptomatic vomitings, from the irritation
on the consentient Nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and quite starv’d and worn him
down. I have narrated the facts
as I saw and observ’d them deliberately
and distinctly, and shall leave
to the philosophic reader to make
what inferences he thinks fit: the
truth of the material circumstances
I will warrant.”</p>

<p class="tb">In this gentleman’s case we may observe,
that the contractile power of his
Fibres was very much weaken’d, their
sensibility in a great measure destroy’d,
and his vital energy far exhausted, by
the long and severe irritation in his
Kidney; and that, when he composed
himself on his Back, the motion of the
Blood through the Lungs was easily
stop’d, in the manner above-mention’d,
viz. by the pressure of the Heart upon
the left Auricle and Pulmonary Veins;
to, which may be added, a small degree
of volition in restraining the organs
of respiration. In this dead state,
we are told, he lay half an hour; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which time the greater part of Blood
was drove into the Veins, as generally
happens soon after respiration stops.
Hence the right Ventricle must have
been greatly distended and severely
stimulated by the refluent Blood, ’till
at length it was brought into a strong
contraction, which put the Blood again
in motion through the whole Body,
and a small spark of vital vigour still
remaining, continued it so for eight
hours afterwards.</p>

<p>The Mind too, in this case, as in
many others of the like kind, was probably
tir’d of its communication with
the Body, and was willing to take its
flight from an habitation in which it
felt so much pain.</p>

<p>I have offered this account to the
curious, not because I think it altogether
satisfactory, but hope, that its
insufficiency may induce others to give
one more adequate.</p>

<p>If colonel Townshend had not compos’d
himself on the Back, could he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have produc’d that surprising effect?
If he had been turn’d on his Side, would
he not have sooner recover’d? Were
not the Doctors very blameable for offering
to go away without using some
means to recover him?</p>

<p>It is observable, that when People
are far exhausted by Diseases, and are
on the brink of dissolution, they generally
lie on their Backs, because they
have not muscular force sufficient to
support the Body on either Side.</p>

<p>From what has been said concerning
the supine portion of the Body, it appears,
that it helps considerably to close
this scene of life, by stopping the
Blood in the Lungs. Hence the immortal
Boerhaave observ’d, “<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>Proximam
mortis causam, et ultimum
ferme omnium Lethalium morborum
effectum esse Peripneumoniam.”</p>

<p>If then the supine position has such
a remarkable effect in stopping the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Motion of the Blood, and consequently
in putting an end to this Life, would
it not be prudent to turn People on
their Sides, and keep them so, who are
so far spent in acute Diseases, that,
they are unable to poize themselves in
that salutary position? Would it not
be often a means of prolonging the fatal,
and of promoting an happy crisis?</p>

<p>When the force of an acute Disorder,
and the strength of Nature are
nearly equal, would not the weight
of the Heart cast the ballance?</p>

<small><i>Of the concurring Causes of the
Night-mare.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>Lthough I have assign’d the supine
position of the Body, and
the pressure of the Heart upon the Pulmonary
Veins and the left Auricle, as
the immediate Causes of this Disorder;
yet it is necessary to consider several
pre-disposing circumstances, which may
render some persons more subject to it
than others, who may perhaps sleep
sometimes on their Backs, and escape
it.</p>

<p>The general primary Causes of this
Disease are a Plethora, or a too great
quantity of Blood, a viscidity or tenacity
of the Fluids, and a weakness or
inertia of the Solids. Hence, young
persons of gross full habits, the robust,
the luxurious, the drunken, and they
who sup late, are most subject to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Night-mare<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. Also Women who are
obstructed; Girls of full, lax habits,
before the eruption of the Menses; of
which I have collected the following
Cases,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I.</span></p>

<p>A young Lady, of a tender, lax
habit, about fifteen, before the Menses
appear’d, was seiz’d with a fit of this
Disease, and groan’d so miserably that
she awoke her Father, who was sleeping
in the next room. He arose, ran
into her chamber, and found her lying
on her Back, and the Blood gushing
plentifully out of her Mouth and Nose.
When he shook her, she recover’d, and
told him, that she thought some great
heavy Man came to her bedside, and,
without farther ceremony, stretched
himself upon her. She had been heard
moaning in sleep several nights before;
but, the next day after she imagin’d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>herself oppress’d by that Man, she
had a copious eruption of the Menses,
which, for that time, remov’d all her
complaints.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I</span>I.</p>

<p>A young Lady, about twenty, of a
full, sanguineous habit, and lax system
of Fibres, labour’d under an obstinate
obstruction of the Catamenia for six
months. About six weeks after her
first period elaps’d, she had a severe
fit of the Night-mare, and next morning
she spit near a pound of Blood,
part of which was coagulated. She
complain’d of an anxiety and oppression
in her Breast, for several days afterwards.
She soon grew well, and
continued so ’till a month had pass’d,
when the Night-mare return’d, and
was succeeded by a spitting of Blood;
but the second fit was not so severe as
the first. She had periodical fits and
discharges of this kind, ’till, by proper
remedies, the redundant streams were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
convey’d through their usual channels,
which at the same time carried off the
cause and heavy effect of the Nightmare.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I</span>II.</p>

<p>A robust servant Girl, about eighteen
years old, was severely oppress’d
with the Night-mare, two or three
nights before every eruption of the
Menses, and us’d to groan so loudly as
to awake her Fellow-servant, who always
shook or turn’d her on her Side;
by which means she recover’d. She
was thus afflicted periodically with it,
’till she took a bedfellow of a different
sex, and bore Children.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I</span>V.</p>

<p>“A Woman, fifty years old, of a
good, full, fleshy, strong habit of
Body, after her Menses stop’d, was
constantly tormented with this Disorder<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>I might add many more instances
of this kind, to shew, that the fair
sex is subject to the severe insults of
this oppressive Disease; but hope these
are sufficient to excite the attention of
others to make observations of this sort,
which are the more necessary, as they
have been too much neglected by writers
on this subject.</p>

<p>When Women pass the fruitful seasons
of life, and the delicate uterine
Tubes, contracting themselves, become
too rigid, and resist the impetus of the
Fluids so as to prevent the usual discharges;
then the Fluids, which were
formerly periodically evacuated, are
amass’d, and collected in the Body, and
occasion a Plethora. Hence, Women,
about that time, often grow fat, heavy,
and sickly, and become more subject
to the Night-mare; because the Heart,
swell’d with redundant Blood, will bear
more heavily on the Pulmonary Veins
and left Auricle, when they happen
to sleep in a supine position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Experience declares, that there is not
a more frequent primary Cause of the
Night-mare than heavy suppers of tough
animal food, and large quantities of
soft, thick malt liquors, which distend,
and lie long in the Stomach; whose
pressure may contribute, in many respects,
to produce this Disorder.</p>

<p>1st. Its pressure on the Aorta Descendens
will determine a greater quantity
of Blood than usual into the Arteries
that belong to the Head; and as
these turgid vessels run contiguous to
the trunks of the Intercostal and eight
pair of Nerves, they may perhaps compress
them so as to render the Heart,
&amp;c. paralytic.</p>

<p>2d. By occupying a large space in
the Abdomen, it hinders the full contraction
of the Diaphragm, and thus
diminishes the cavity of the Thorax,
prevents the necessary expansion of the
Lungs, and consequently obstructs the
motion of the Blood through them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. Anatomy informs us, that the
Diaphragm is not perpendicular to the
Spine of the Back, but forms an acute
angle with it, and is extended obliquely
upwards to the Sternum<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>. Hence,
in a supine position of the Body, the
Diaphragm may be considered as an
inclin’d plane, upon which the surcharg’d
Stomach must rest; and its
weight on this part will increase the
pressure of the Heart on the Pulmonary
Veins, as it is connected to the opposite
side of the Diaphragm by the Pericardium.</p>

<p>Every one knows that a hearty meal
disposes People to sleep. This effect
was commonly attributed to the pressure
of the Stomach on the descending
Aorta: but Doctor Stuart has oppos’d
that theory<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>. Doctor Haller has seconded
him, and has given his reasons
for it. He says, “Si exquisitiori Anatome
in situm Ventriculi &amp; Aortæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>inquisiveris, reperies vix unquam
Aortam a Ventriculo comprimi posse.
Dum enim distenditur, antrorsum
recedit, et Curvaturam parvam retrorsum
ostendit Aortæ, quæ ea Curvatura,
interjecto Pancreate, comprehenditur<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>”</p>

<p>This is certainly a just account of
the appearance of the Stomach, when
it is distended in a dead Body, where
the Integuments of the Abdomen, and
all resistance to the Stomach’s rising,
is taken away: but, if we consider
the Stomach distended by any means
in a living Body, where these Integuments
still remain in an active state,
and resist the motion of the Stomach
forwards and upwards; then a great
part of its pressure must fall on the
Aorta, and confirm the old opinion.
That part of the Diaphragm, through
which the Oesophagus passes, must be
the center of motion in this case; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>allowing, that the Stomach moves a
little upwards and forwards, in a distended
state, yet, as the Abdominal
Viscera are in such a fluid or fluctuating
condition, that place, which may be deserted
by the distention of the Stomach,
will be fill’d up by the Pancreas; and
by this means, the Aorta may suffer as
great a pressure as if it was immediately
in contact with the Stomach: the
argument, which that industrious Gentleman
adds, may be owing to the peculiarity
of his own constitution; viz.
“Imo vero aucti a pastu veneris stimuli
demonstrant, eo tempore motum
Sanguinis in Aortam descendentem
potius majorem esse, quam
minorem<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>”.</p>

<p>Doctor Haller seems to have levell’d
the force of this argument against a full
Stomach being any cause of the Nightmare;
but I might mention many facts
here to prove the contrary, and among
the rest, might add my own case; but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>to avoid prolixity, I shall confine myself
to one instance.</p>

<p>A corpulent Clergyman, about fifty
years old, who is very fond of strong
beer and flesh suppers, but so subject
to the Night-mare, that he is obliged
to stint himself to a certain quantity
every night; whenever he happens to
take an over-dose, he groans so loudly
that he often awakes all the People in
the house. He has assur’d me, that,
in these fits, he imagin’d the Devil
came to his bedside, seiz’d him by the
Throat, and endeavour’d to choak him.
Next day he observ’d the black impressions
of his hard Fingers on his
Neck. After being at a wedding or
christening, he never escapes it; and
his Servant is oblig’d to watch him all
the next night, and rescue him from
the Paws of Satan, whose dreadful approach
always makes him roar loud
enough to awake the Servant, if he
should happen to be asleep. The Ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>vant
told me, he always found his
Master lying on his Back in the fit.</p>

<p>Hoffman says, “<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>Plethoricos omni
cura fugere opportet decubitum supinum,
facile enim Incubo premuntur,
cujus causa a Sanguinis stagnatione
in Pulmones deducenda est.”</p>

<p>Doctor Haller assigns a different reason
for heavy suppers preventing rest,
viz. “<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>Sed etiam cibi immeabiles
particulæ in Cerebro minus facile
trajactæ, comprimendo Medullam
somnum minus benignum faciunt.”</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that this Disorder
attacks People only in sleep; which,
Doctor Young says<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>, is owing to the
effect that sleep has in increasing all the
symptoms of a Plethora. It is true,
that sleep retards the motion of the
Blood, and checks the serous secretions.
“<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.In vasis vero serosis, Lymphaticis et
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Nervosis circulatio parva, et sæpe
nulla est.”</p>

<p>There is no occasion to go about
proving that the secretion of urine is
lessened in bed, for common experience
sufficiently evinces it. And it appears,
by the experiments of Doctor Robinson<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
and Gorter<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>, that perspiration
is considerably less in the night than
in the day. It must be allow’d, that
the heat of the bed-cloaths will rarify
the Blood, and also contribute to an
universal distension of the Vessels: but
all these seem to be rather the effects
of lying quiet in a warm bed, than of
sleep alone. If so, People might be
as readily seiz’d with the Night-mare
while they are awake in these circumstances,
as when they are asleep, which
never happens.</p>

<p>I really can find no way of accounting
for this Phænomenon, unless we
have recourse to the Soul, or that ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>tive
principle within us, whose operations,
during sleep, are either greatly
impeded, or altogether suspended. It
is therefore less sensible of any uneasiness
in the Body than when we are
awake, and the faculties of the Mind
are in action, which is compell’d, by
some innate necessity, to avoid any
pain, as soon as it perceives it in the
Body.</p>

<p>While we are awake, lie on our
Backs, and feel any uneasiness in that
position, we immediately alter it: but,
in sleep, we are not so soon conscious
of the Blood’s stoppage in the Lungs,
nor have we the means of removing
that dangerous obstruction so much in
our power, because the voluntary motions
are then suspended, without which,
the position of the Body cannot be
changed, nor the cause of the obstruction
remov’d.</p>

<p>The insensibility of the Lungs too
may contribute to render the obstruction
greater, before the Mind becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
conscious of it; for we don’t find,
that obstructions and inflammations of
the Lungs are attended with such an
acute pain, as when these Disorders attack
other parts of the Body, the Liver,
Spleen, and Omentum excepted.</p>

<p>The Night-mare may sometimes seize
very plethoric Persons, when they don’t
lie directly on the Back; for part of
the Heart’s weight may fall on the Pulmonary
Veins, in a lateral position of
the Body.</p>

<p>By way of a brief recapitulation of
what has been offer’d concerning the
Causes in general of this Disorder, I
shall conclude this Chapter with the
following corollaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 1. That they who have a very
sensible system of Fibres, and are soon
affected by a stimulus, are least subject
to the Night-mare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 2. That sluggish, inactive constitutions
are most liable to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 3. That the severity of the fit
will be always proportional to the sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>sibility
of the Fibres, and the quantity
of Blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 4. That the duration of a fit
will be proportional to the sensibility
and vigour of the constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 5. That they who sup sparingly,
and never sleep on their Backs,
are seldom or never afflicted with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 6. That it is most common in
those seasons of the year, which most
increase the volume of the Fluids: hence
spring and autumn are its most fertile
periods.</p>

<h2><span class="gesperrt2">CHAP. V</span>I.<br /><br />

<small><i>Of the Prognostics of this Disorder.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">L</span>Est this Disorder should be
thought altogether the work of
Imagination, and necessary precautions
should be neglected to prevent frequent
returns of it; I have collected the sentiments
of the ancient Physicians concerning
its consequences; whose authority,
in this Disease, as well as in
many others, I believe, we may safely
rely on; because they were wholly ignorant
of its immediate cause, and had
no favourite theory to support, but
faithfully related facts of this kind as
they really appear’d.</p>

<p>We find that most of the old observators
who have mention’d the Night-mare,
reckon it a forerunner of some
terrible Disorder: I shall here translate
these quotations, for the benefit of my
English readers, and add the originals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by way of notes, for the perusal of the
learned.</p>

<p>“We should endeavour to stop it
in the beginning; for, when it returns
every night, it portends either
Madness, the Epilepsy, or a Mortification<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.”</p>

<p>“The Night-mare is a Disorder
which attacks People sleeping, and is
of no trifling nature, but precedes
dreadful Disorders; viz. the Epilepsy,
a kind of Melancholy, and an Apoplexy;
and if it returns frequently, it
shews that they are not far off<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>.”</p>

<p>“The Disease call’d the Night-mare
is not a Dæmon, but rather the fore-runner
of the Epilepsy, Madness, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>a Mortification. We should stop it
in the beginning; for, when it continues
long, and returns often, it
produces some of the above-mention’d
Disorders<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>.”</p>

<p>“If they, whom the Night-mare
seizes in sleep, have cold Sweats,
and a palpitation of the Heart after
they awake, they are very bad symptoms.
They who are long affected
with it, have great reason to fear
some desperate Disorder of the Head,
viz. a Vertigo, an Apoplexy, Madness,
a Palsy, an Epilepsy, or some
sudden Death: and there are many
instances of People being found dead
in their beds of this Disorder<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The celebrated Boerhaave has mention’d
the Night-mare among the principal
symptoms of an Apoplexy<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate these prognostics
by modern instances, I have collected
several cases, but shall confine
myself to the two following.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I.</span></p>

<p>A Gentleman, about thirty years
old, of a full sanguineous habit, and
a little intemperate, was tormented
with the Night-mare almost every
night for two years. He bled often,
which gave him short ease; but was
at length seiz’d with an Apoplexy,
while he had the glass in one Hand
and the pipe in the other, and expir’d
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">CASE I</span>I.</p>

<p>A Gentleman, about forty-five years
old, of a corpulent phlegmatic habit
of Body, and an inactive disposition
of Mind, complain’d of a vast oppression
which he felt in his sleep; upon
which he consulted a Physician, who
prescrib’d both bleeding and purging,
to be repeated as often as it return’d.
This prescription was follow’d with
success at first, but it became so often
necessary, that the patient was not able
to bear such evacuations. He therefore
was obliged to sleep in a chair
all night, to avoid the Night-mare.
But one night he ventur’d to bed, and
was found half dead in the morning.
He continued paralytic two years; and
after taking the round of Bath and
Bristol, &amp;c. to no purpose, he died
an Idiot.</p>

<p>“—D. Abraham Schonnichel, who
was a Captain of horse in the Emperor’s
army, and being fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
drink, was afflicted with the Night-mare
as often as he lay on his Back,
after taking many medicines it became
less frequent. But when, on
account of his intemperance, it return’d,
I order’d his Chamberlain to
rouse him whenever he heard him
groan, in sleep; by which means,
the fits were shorten’d, but about
two years after he died of an Epilepsy<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.”</p>

<p>Cœlus Aurelianus says<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>, that this disease
was epidemic and kill’d many at
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Romans took little breakfast
or dinner, but made supper their principal
meal, ’tis probable, that they were
very subject to the Night-mare, especially
during the Saturnalia, when they
held all their repotia or drinking-matches,
and indulged themselves in
all kinds of intemperance at night.</p>

<p>Galen says, “That the Night-mare
is a kind of an Epilepsy, which happens
in sleep; and that if it continues
long, it will turn to a real Epilepsy<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>.”</p>

<p>“An accidental Night-mare is not
dangerous; but if it be habitual, it
threatens an Epilepsy, Apoplexy, or
Melancholy, especially if the Person
be subject to a Vertigo in the daytime.
If it attacks one between
sleeping and waking, it denotes the
Epilepsy to be very near; but it is
remarkably dangerous, when a cold
Sweat, a palpitation of the Heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>a Spasm, or a Fainting fit, succeed
it<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>.”</p>

<p>“Hoffman mentions the Night-mare
among the Symptoms of an Apoplexy,
that was cur’d by an over-dose
of Camphire<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.”</p>

<p>From these concurring authorities,
and the instances that have been given,
we have sufficient reason to believe,
that the above Diseases often succeed
frequent fits of the Night-mare. It is
highly probable, that the stagnation of
the Blood (which occasions it) in the Pulmonary
Veins, right Ventricle, Vena
Cava, and the Sinuses of the Brain,
may form obstinate obstructions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>leave the rudiments of Polypi in these
parts; which may afterwards produce
fatal effects. From the situation of the
lateral Sinuses, it appears, that in a
supine position of the Body, the Blood
must move out of them, contrary to
its own gravity. Hence, by their turgescence,
the Cerebellum may be compress’d,
and the animal functions impeded.
It was probably to prevent this
pressure on the Cerebellum, and to
promote the return of the Blood from
the Head, that Nature has plac’d these
reservoirs in the upper part of the
Heads of Quadrupeds.</p>

<p>“If this disorder grows more severe,
there is danger of being suffocated
in the very fit, and of its producing
an Apoplexy or some terrible disorder
of the Head, either by pouring
Blood into the Ventricles, or substance
of the Brain, or by obstructing
the Carotid Arteries, or Choroid
Plexus: therefore such Diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
are to be prevented by proper methods<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>.”</p>

<p>Does not this disease kill many who
go to bed in perfect health, and are
found dead in the morning? Does not
the Night-mare carry many drunkards
out of this world? Is it not a species
of an Apoplexy? Is it not the final
cure of all chronic Diseases?</p>

<small><i>Of the Cure.</i></small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>Hen People are found in a fit
of the Night-mare, the most
effectual remedy is to rouse them as
soon as possible, by changing the position
of the Body, and applying some
keen stimulus immediately, such as
pricking with a pin, speaking loud, &amp;c.
and if they recover the least degree of
voluntary motion, the happy crisis is
for that time obtain’d, as Actuarius
and Willis observ’d.</p>

<p>I have often been so much oppress’d
by this enemy of rest, that I would
have given ten thousand worlds like
this for some Person that would either
pinch, shake, or turn me off my Back;
and I have been so much afraid of its
intolerable insults, that I have slept in
a chair all night, rather than give it
an opportunity of attacking me in an
horizontal position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Lower relates a remarkable
similar case, which I shall here translate.
He says, “<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>I knew a Gentleman,
who, in every other respect, enjoy’d
perfect health, but was so subject to
the Night-mare, that, whenever he
slept on his Back, he was seiz’d
with it in such a violent manner,
that he was oblig’d to keep a Servant
in the same bed with him; who,
upon hearing his Master groan and
Sigh (with which Symptoms it us’d
to begin) immediately turn’d him on
his Side; by which means it was,
and may be always, remov’d.”</p>

<p>’Tis observable, that people are rous’d
out of a fit of the Night-mare, sometimes,
by sound alone. I remember
to have been under it, when a Servant
came in the morning to make a fire,
and let the coal-box fall at the door;
the noise of which effectually reliev’d
me. The vibrations or undulations of
the air beating upon the drum of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Ear, may act as a successful stimulus
in this case.</p>

<p>As this Disease seems to arise immediately
from a supine position of the
Body in sleep, we should take care to
prevent it before we fall asleep, by
composing the Body on either Side.
The sagacious Hoffman observes, that
the safest posture in sleep, is on either
Side, with the Head rais’d, and the
Limbs bent inwards to the trunk of
the Body<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>.</p>

<p>Some ingenious men have imagin’d,
that the bending of the Limbs in sleep
is owing to the strong tendency which
the flexor Muscles have to contraction;
but I humbly suppose, it is rather a
voluntary motion, intended to fix the
Body on the Side, without the continued
action of any of the voluntary
Muscles afterwards; for without the
flexion of the Joints in sleep, it would
be a kind of labour to keep the Body
pois’d on such an narrow surface. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>demonstrate this, I shall avoid mathematics,
and appeal to common sense,
for an easy experiment. Suppose one
should endeavour to poise a thin plate
of tin on its edge upon a smooth, level
table; if he be not an expert equilibrist,
he will find it difficult; but if
he bends the plate, then the problem
becomes as easy as the well known
method of making an egg stand on
its end.</p>

<p>This easy method, which nature has
contriv’d to preserve the human Body
on its side, is a sufficient recommendation
of that position, and a strong
precaution against lying on the Back,
which is the posture of dead Bodies.</p>

<p>Before any regular or effectual plan
of curing, or rather preventing, this
Disease, can be propos’d, it will be
always necessary to consider minutely
the primary or pre-disposing causes of
it, formerly mention’d.</p>

<p>If the primary cause be a weakness
of the Fibres, then strengthening or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
astringent medicines are proper; which,
by increasing the cohesion of the constituent
particles of the Solids, will
make the Fibres more dense, brace
them up to a proper pitch, and quicken
their vibrations. The principal Medicines
of this class are iron, and its preparations,
the Bark, the wild Valerian-root,
and the cold Bath.</p>

<p>If it arises from an inertia or indolence
of the Solids, nervous medicines
will best answer that indication; which,
by stimulating the lazy inactive Fibres,
will increase their elasticity, invigorate
their contractions, accelerate the motion,
and break the tenacity of the
Blood.</p>

<p>If the Blood be too thick, attenuants
should be us’d, such as, spiritus Mendereri<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>,
vegetable subacid liquors, saponaceous
medicines, and plenty of vinegar
at meals, which, according to the
great Boerhaave, is a powerful diluent<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>A Plethora or redundance of Blood,
is certainly the most general cause of
the Night-mare, and requires immediate
evacuations, which principally consist
in bleeding or purging. But the
former is most effectual. However,
Bleeding should not be often repeated,
unless absolutely necessary, lest, it should
become a custom, which might, at the
same time, procure a short intermission,
and increase the cause of the Disease;
and also prove inconvenient and dangerous;
for if, at any establish’d period,
Bleeding should be omitted, then
the person is expos’d to all the bad
effects of a Plethora, enumerated by
Boerhaave, viz. Inflammations, Suppurations,
Gangrenes and Death<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.</p>

<p>It is well known, that nothing genenerates
Blood faster, or contributes more
to a Plethora, than bleeding often, which
some are fond of, without assigning
any reason for it, except its being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>custom, which experience proves a very
bad one.</p>

<p>Van Sweiten says, “He saw a Woman,
who, being subject to violent
affections of the Mind, was bled
above sixty times in one year. She
by that means grew very fat, and
increas’d her weight 150 pounds in
a few months. By bleeding often
new Blood was generated, and the
necessity of bleeding became more
frequent, ’till she was so far relax’d,
that she fell into a Dropsy<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.”</p>

<p>He adds, “That bleeding, which
some use by way of precaution, is
a bad custom, since it weakens the
Solids, and renders the Body more
subject to a fresh accumulation of
Fluids.”</p>

<p>Experience has convinced me of the
truth of this observation; for, while
I practis’d bleeding every month or six
weeks, I found the Night-mare return’d
on me at these periods, rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>aggravated than abated. My bad success
made me alter my method; and, instead
of drawing eight or ten ounces
of blood at once, I drew twenty, and
liv’d low, on thin, astringent diet, for
a few days afterwards; in which time
the dilated vessels contracted themselves,
and resisted the sudden distension,
which taking large quantities of
nourishing diet, after plentiful evacuations,
must always produce; as our
medical Bard justly expresses it,</p>

<p class="noindent">
“Too greedily th’ exhausted Veins absorb
The recent Chyle<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>.”<br />
</p>

<p>By observing Boerhaave’s method of
curing a Plethora, viz. using a thin,
light diet after bleeding, and gradually
prolonging the time between each evacuation,
I have reduc’d my bleedings
to one every autumn; and (thank Heaven)
have in a great measure conquer’d
that Monster of the night, which so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>often threaten’d me with immediate destruction.</p>

<p>Experience also assures us, that large
evacuations may be made by strong
purges; such as Jalap, Scammon. &amp;c.
which greatly dissolve, and diminish
the quantity of the Blood.</p>

<p>Hence, we see the reason why Paulus
Egeneta justly prescrib’d Scammony
in this Disease<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>. But in this kind of
evacuations, Boerhaave’s salutary rule
should be also observ’d; viz. “Omissione
sensim introducta.”</p>

<p>’Tis needless here to take notice of
all the ill-adapted farrago of Medicines
prescrib’d by many of the old Physicians,
who did not know the cause of
this Disorder.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why Piony was
reckon’d, by them, such a famous specific
for the Night-mare, which, taken
internally, is only a gentle attenuant:
and ’tis very surprising, that Doctor
Willis should be so superstitious as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>recommend balls made of Piony and
Corral to be tied about the Neck, by
way of a sacred nostrum against this
Disease<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>.</p>

<p>Temperate living is certainly the most
effectual method of preventing this and
many other Disorders. Vegetable and
flesh meat of easy digestion; thin, subacid,
diluent liquors, taken in moderate
quantities; light or no suppers;
brisk exercise of all kinds; high pillows,
and sleeping on the Side, are the
most sovereign Prophylactics, or preventives.</p>

<p>If People subject to the Night-mare
be so fond of heavy flesh-suppers, that
they can neither rest with them nor
without them, they should sup early,
and sit up or exercise two or three
hours afterwards; and when they go
to bed, they should lie on the right
Side, that the food may have the advantage
of its own gravity in passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>out of the Stomach into the Guts. In
that position the Heart will fall on the
Mediastinum, which, being a flexible
Membrane, will be an easier support
to the Heart than if it play’d against
the hard Ribs, which is always the
consequence of lying on the left Side.</p>

<p>When the fair Sex is oppress’d with
this Disorder, and the precedent cause
is an obstruction of the Catamenia, the
defect of that natural discharge may
be supply’d by a moderate bleeding;
and proper remedies should be us’d to
clear the obstructed tubes, and open
the flood-gates to promote the ebb of
the next full tide. But if the cause be
common to both sexes, the same methods
may be follow’d, proper allowance
being made for the delicacy of the
female constitution.</p>

<p>Excessive drinking at night, as well
as excessive eating, should be avoided;
but of the two evils, the former is the
lesser, as our British Celsus observes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">“Tutior autem est in potione, quam
in esca, intemperantia<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>.”</p>

<p>As intoxication subjects People to
most dreadful fits of this Disorder, as
well as to many other accidents, it
should, by all means, be shun’d. Lucretius
has so well painted its bad effects,
that, I presume, my polite reader
will think his description of it neither
tedious nor foreign.</p>

if we reflect on several phænomena of Animal Motion,
that assertion will not appear so absurd. ’Tis
universally allow’d, that the Muscles of the Larynx
and Tongue, Adductors and Abductors of the Eyes
are of the Voluntary kind; yet, by endeavouring
to imitate those who Stammer or Squint, these disagreeable
habits are acquir’d so, as not to be afterwards
corrected by the strongest efforts of the Mind.
As the Heart of an Infant beats, at a mean, about
11520 times every 24 hours, during the first year,
’tis probable, that, by this frequent Motion, the action
of that Muscle may become independent of the
Will ever afterwards: tho’ it might be as Voluntary at
first, as the action of the Muscles concern’d in
sucking the Nurse’s Breast.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
